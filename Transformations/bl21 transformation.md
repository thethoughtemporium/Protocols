## Bl21 transformation

### Materials

  * distilled water
  * sterile 15ml tubes
  * sterile 1.5ml tubes
  * calcium chloride
  * syringe + syringe filter
  * LB broth
  * LB agar plate + appropriate antibiotic 
  * Innoculation loop
  * Sterile spreader
  * Bunser burner or torch
  * Pipettes/tips
  * 15ml centrifuge
  * 1.5ml centrifuge
  * heat block
  * Ice bath
  * shaking/rotating incubator


### stock prep

  1. Prepare a 1M calcium chloride solution by dissolving 1.1g in 10ml of water
  2. transfer 1ml of this solution to a fresh tube and add 9ml of distilled water
  3. filter sterilize into a fresh tube. 
  4. Label the result "transformation buffer"

### transformation

#### Day 1
  1. The day before performing the transformation protocol, innoculate 10ml of LB broth in a 15ml tube with BL21 cells, or any other ecoli variety
  2. place into rotating/shaking incubator at 37C and let grow overnight

#### Day2
  1. Innoculate 10ml of fresh LB with 100ul of overnight solution
    - Let grow for exactly 2H (do not let overgrow)
  2. Chill culture on ice for 10 minutes.
  3. Pellet cells by centrifugation at max speed for 2-3 minutes (4500rpm was used on my centrifuge)
  4. Decant off liquid and resuspend pellet in 1ml ice cold transformation buffer
  5. Transfer liquid to 1.5ml tube
  6. Pellet cells at 12000rpm for 30 seconds
  7. Pipette off liquid, do not disutrb pellet
  8. Add 1ml of ice cold transformation buffer and resuspend by pipetting gently
  9. Pellet again at 12000rpm for 30 seconds
  10. Pipette off liquid
  11. The pellet should contain enough cells for 3-4 reactions. Add 100ul of transformation buffer for the number of reactions you wish to perform (100-400ul)
    - If doing more than 1 reaction, seperate liquid into 100ul aliqotes in seperate tubes
    - Keep on ice until ready to heat.
  12. Add 50-400ug of DNA to each tube (50 for easy plasmids/strains, 400 for stubborn ones. Adjust as needed)
  13. Incubate mixture on ice for 25 min
  14. Preheat heatblock to 42C
  15. After incubation in the fridge heat shock cells in heat block for exactly 90s
  16. immeditaly chill in ice bath after heat shocking for 3-5 min
  17. Add 1ml of fresh LB to each tube, and allow to recover in an incubator at 37C for 1-2H with shaking/rotation

If using turbo or other easy strains:
  * plate 100ul of recovered solution on appropriate antibiotic or selection plates
  * spread using sterile spreader or innoculation loops

If using BL21:
  * Pellet cells by centrifugation at 12000rpm for 10s
  * plate entire pellet + 100ul of media
  * spread using sterile spreader or innoculation loop

  17. Incubate plate at 37C for 2-3 days until colonies develop
